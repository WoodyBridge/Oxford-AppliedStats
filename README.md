This code was created with a research project: An Explanatory Analysis of Airbnb Density Within Inner London Districts.

The reasearch project used data form InsideAirbnb.com to create a multivariate regression model to understand the components of Airbnb Density within London. The regression models used are OLS, Possion, and Negative Binomial.
